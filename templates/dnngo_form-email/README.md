# WebMarkets DNNGo Powerforms Email Templates

## User Email Template

To implement this template in a site, you'll need to fill in the following information:

1. Replace [BUSINESS NAME] with the name of the business.
2. Update wording of email to reflect the purpose of the form this is for.
3. Update the `<a>` tag's title to reference the Business at [BUSINESS WEBSITE], and the link to lead to the business's website.
4. Ensure that the `<img>` linked is the business's logo, and replace [BUSINESS NAME] in the alt tag.

## Admin Email Templates

We have two admin email templates. The _WebMarkets_ template should be used for _WebMarkets_ clients, whereas the _WebMarkets Medical_ template should be used for _Webmarkets Medical_ clients. These templates don't need editing, but feel free to add finishing touches!
