# webmarkets DNNGo Form Plugin Email Templates

As of 2024, webmarkets has switched from using DNNGo PowerForms in DNN websites to DNNGo FormBuilder. The templates are largely the same, but they have different syntax for injecting variables. Please choose the folder of templates applicable.

## User Email Template

To implement this template in a site, you'll need to fill in the following information:

1. Replace (Business Name) with the name of the business.
2. Update wording of email to reflect the purpose of the form this is for.
3. Update the `<a>` tag's title to reference the Business at (Business Site), and the link to lead to the business's website.
4. Ensure that the `<img>` linked is the business's logo, and replace (Business Name) in the alt tag.

## Admin Email Templates

We have two admin email templates. The _webmarkets_ template should be used for _webmarkets_ clients, whereas the _webmarkets medical_ template should be used for _webmarkets medical_ clients. These templates don't need editing, but feel free to add finishing touches!
